== Frequently Asked Questions ==

It blocks, the lightbox for other plugins?

No, for the most cases. The plugins searches for any other instanses and runs the just the one. However, if you or your developer had hardcoded the scripts on the page. The plugin can\'t recognise the other lightbox. It works only with the recommended.

Whats Wordpress media pattern?

Wordpress media pattern :   `<a href=\"image url\"><img src=\"image url\" /></a>`
